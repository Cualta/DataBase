	after we finish discussing, I will post the points on myCourses and then you can all let me know on Teams if you agree with your grade
19:42:07 From Elisa Schaeffer, Prof. To Everyone:
	if anyone needs clarification on which question or questions were a bit weaker and cost you points, we can do that as well, although I think it mostly becomes clear while discussing :)
19:51:01 From Elisa Schaeffer, Prof. To Everyone:
	lemme know when you are back

20:02:34 From Elisa Schaeffer, Prof. To Everyone:
	Use a collective name or, less ideally, a plural form. For example (in order of preference) staff and employees.
	    Do not prefix with tbl or any other such descriptive prefix or Hungarian notation.
	    Never give a table the same name as one of its columns and vice versa.
	    Avoid, where possible, concatenating two table names together to create the name of a relationship table. Rather than cars_mechanics prefer services.

20:16:08 From Elisa Schaeffer, Prof. To Everyone:
	does each invoice correspond to just one service?
20:16:27 From Elisa Schaeffer, Prof. To Everyone:
	or can two or more services be billed jointly?
20:17:13 From Elisa Schaeffer, Prof. To Everyone:
	my main questions are: 1) does the category need to be a table or can it be a column in service?
20:17:55 From Elisa Schaeffer, Prof. To Everyone:
	2) could appointment and service be in a single table if there is only one appointment per service and only one service per appointment?
